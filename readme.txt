Canvas instead of Html and CSS

This is barely working and would require way too much work to be a viable framework.

The goal is to have a viable alternative to html and css. 

What we have so far:

A Typescript and nodes project that can load varies "controls" (text box, checkbox, etc.../) onto the screen. 
It uses a grid layout, where you don't specified the sizes of the controls.

Future goals (that will probably never happen):

Create a language that provides the following:
Compiles to web assembly on the front end.
Runs a rest api on the back end.
Provides a simple nosql database.
Shares data structures between backend and front end.
Automatic two-way binding between front end and back end
uses canvas as a replacement for html and css
